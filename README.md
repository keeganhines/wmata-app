Simple web app to pull data from the DC Metro system API. Pulls some very specific information; this app is useless to pretty much anyone but me. It's hosted a [google app engine](http://wheres-the-train.appspot.com/).

It's looking good thanks to [jQuery mobile](http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/methods/), workin good thanks to [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/) and [webapp2](https://webapp-improved.appspot.com/), and hostin good thanks to [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs).
